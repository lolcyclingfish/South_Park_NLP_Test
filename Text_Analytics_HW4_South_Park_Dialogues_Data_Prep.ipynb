    "- What are the topics of the script? You could make a break down by character. Do these topics evolve over time (e.g., by act)?\n",
    "- Who talks (spends time) with whom? Does it change over time? Which fraction of the talk does each speaker contribute?\n",
    "- What is the mood of each speaker (e.g., the average sentiment of the words they utter)? Does it change over time? Does it depend on who they are talking to or who or what they are talking about?\n",
    "- Who or what does each speaker talk about? What is the sentiment of the speaker about each entity (i.e., what is the sentiment of the words that appear near them in the dialogue?). You will probably want to do coreference resolution (to identify what pronouns matches what noun) when identifying who talks about what or whom. In dialogs, participants agree about the antecedents of pronouns, so you may want to process consecutive utterances from the various dialogue participants as a single unit of text for the purpose of coreference resolution.\n",
    "- What are the Named Entities (e.g., people, places, organizations) that appear in your script? Are there any generalizations about when or where they appear?\n",
    "- What are the similarities between the characters in the script (e.g., defined in terms of vector similarity between each character’s ‘corpus’? Which characters are the most and least similar to each other, and do these results have an intuitive explanation?\n",

Phinehas was depressed, until he realized that if he couldn't be the first to discover places, he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas!  Phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the Aborigine children at Uluru, and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of Nepal.  But now the most wonderful part. You see, after having sex with all those children, Phinehas realized that... molesting all those kids... had made him immortal.\\n\",\n",
